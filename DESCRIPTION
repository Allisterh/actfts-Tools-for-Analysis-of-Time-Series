Description: This package provides tools for performing autocorrelation analysis of time series data.
    It includes functions to compute and visualize the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF).
    Additionally, it performs the Dickey-Fuller, KPSS and Phillips–Perron unit root tests to assess the stationarity of time series.
